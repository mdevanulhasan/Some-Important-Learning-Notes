For avoiding this problem, you can follow some steps which are given below:

1. At first you should stop "Apache" and "MySQL" in your "xampp control panel".

2. Go to the path: C:\xampp\mysql\backup Copy here everything

3. Go to the path: C:\xampp\mysql\data And paste it here everything

4. Here you will see a pop-up: Replace or Skip Files
   Click Replace the files in the destination

5. Now you can start "Apache" and "MySQL" without any hassle.

Hopefully, it will work properly.
